### Setup RVM (Ruby Version Manager)

**_(Optional, but recommended) To ensure developers don't have the issue machine dependencies, such as "It's working on my machine", we recommend using RVM to manage the ruby version._**

Please follow the instructions on the [RVM website](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) to install RVM.

In order to use `bundler` to install the required gems, you will need to install the `ruby` version specified in the `Gemfile` (2.7.5). You can do this by running the following command:

`rvm install 2.7.5`
