### Docs site

The docs are built using automatic tools and reporters
* Static content from each package README.md file is injected as the main page for the package.
* The README file contains files generated by the build flow
    * [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) generated reference.
    * [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) generated bundle size report.
    * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test reporters showing test cases and results
* Additional tools are available in the docs setup in the form of components ( UML schema, Tabs, Search, Code viewers).


### Build
To build the entire content run `yarn docs` at the root level.

### Local serve
Run `yarn docs:internal` | `yarn docs:public`
